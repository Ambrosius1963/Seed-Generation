# Seed-Generation
Game map seeds generated using Perlin noise

# Overview
This project aims to develop a 3D seed generation system using Perlin noise maps for procedural terrain generation. The primary goal is to create a scientific representation of seed generation while allowing for potential terrain expansion. As software engineers, this project helps us enhance our skills in procedural generation, data visualization, and working with C# in both VS Code and Unity. The focus is on optimizing code for broad applicability while maintaining a minimal and efficient structure.

## Description
The Seed-Generation project generates procedural 3D terrain maps based on layered Perlin noise maps. The seed generator will be visualized through a forensic scatterplot to analyze its behavior scientifically. While the primary focus is on the seed generator itself, a basic terrain representation will be implemented to showcase the results. This software is designed to be adaptable to various use cases beyond gaming, such as data visualization and simulation applications.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore and implement procedural terrain generation through seed-based Perlin noise mapping. The core objective is to generate and analyze procedural seeds scientifically while developing transferable skills in C# and Unity. The project also aims to optimize code structure to ensure broad applicability across different environments.
